## About

Inferno King Grimm is a boss mod that takes the existing Nightmare King Grimm bossfight and changes it up significantly

The fight is split up into three different stages, with each stage getting harder than the last

It also includes several modifications to existing moves, as well as some new ones

There is also an optional hard mode that can be enabled using the settings menu found on the title screen

Hard mode includes harder versions of the existing moves, a health upgrade, and a new move exclusive to hard mode

## Installation

The mod can be installed via the modinstaller. You can download the modinstaller here : https://radiance.host/mods/ModInstaller.exe
